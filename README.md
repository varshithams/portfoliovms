This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
I know coding enough to be a geek and can also train you to speak.

Born to an engineering couple, one might say that the apple didn't fall too far away from the tree. I grew up with a fascination towards science and technology, and reached college with a will to be an engineer; the only hiccup was the confusion of what kind of engineer I wanted to be. That is when I dived into the ‘C’ of opportunities, and since then my life has become a code, constantly developing and consistently evolving. 

I graduated with a degree in computer science and a job at Deloitte, along with a bunch of projects that solidified my interest in the field. I worked for almost two years at Deloitte, with the most diverse and intelligent minds, gathered all the experience the MNC provided, worked with and for several international clients, earned an award for my contribution there and as I felt I was ready for the next step, I took the jump and landed on a Master’s in Information Systems Management program at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh USA. Deloitte was just the prologue; my story has only begun to shape, with Carnegie Mellon being the next ***pitstop!***

On the contrary side, the talker that I am compelled me to join Junior Chamber International, 
an International NGO of young people (18-40 age group) with members across 124 countries. I became a certified zonal trainer, providing personality development training that includes effective public speaking, soft skill development, and several other topics like these, for youth across different strata of the society. It's incredible how my natural inclination to talk could lead to being such an effective tool in my arsenal.

Deloitte was an eye-opener, Carnegie Mellon is the gate to bigger opportunities, and JCI is where I found my voice to face the world. So, here's to the apple that stayed close to the engineering tree, but dared to dream differently.

# What I hope to learn

1. Learn to create effective data visualizations using various tools and mediums.
2. Build a publicly accessible portfolio showcasing my work in data visualization.
3. Learn how to tailor narratives to suit specific target audiences.
4. And obviously learn how to tell stories with data!

## Projects
1. ### Traffic Sign Recognition : [Publication](https://www.irjet.net/archives/V8/i6/IRJET-V8I6754.pdf)
   Engineered a technology using Python enabling vehicles to detect and classify traffic signs through computer vision and
advanced image processing techniques; launching a sign positioned before camera, system swiftly detects the sign, encloses
with a green box, superimposes its name, and activates the voice output to promptly alert the driver with 92% accuracy


2. ### Blood bank management
   Designed a web application that provides details of blood donors, blood banks, and hospitals at that location using MySQL as
backend, HTML, CSS as frontend, and Django as a web framework; created a self-registration process to donate or get information if in need of blood


## Skills
C, C++, Java, SAP ABAP, Data Structures and Algorithms

## What else do I do?

I indulge myself in [extra curricular activities](https://www.instagram.com/jci.mysore.brindhavan/).
